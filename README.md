# Cooking recipes as flowcharts

# Here are cooking recipes created as flowcharts. For each recipe there should be a folder with an english name. In this folder is a readme file in which you can find the source of the recipe as link and per language there should be a draw.io and an image file or a pdf-file with a short language-identifyer as name and inside in which you can see the flowchart of the recipe. Feel free to fork and add new recipes.
