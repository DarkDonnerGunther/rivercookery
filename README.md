# Cooking recipes as flowcharts

# Here are cooking recipes created as flowcharts. For each recipe there should be a folder with an english name. In this folder is a readme file in which you can find the source of the recipe and per language there should be a drawio-file and an image file with a short language-identifyer as name. Inside of the files you can see the flowchart of the recipe. Feel free to fork and add new recipes.
