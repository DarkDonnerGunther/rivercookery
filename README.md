# Cooking recipes as flowcharts

# Here cooking recipes are created as flowcharts. For each recipe there should be a folder with an English name. In this folder is a readme file in which you can find the source of the recipe as a link and per language there should be a draw.io and an image file in which you can see the flowchart of the recipe. Feel free to make a fork and add new recipes.
